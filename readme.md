# Snake and Ladder Game

## Overview

This is a **Snake and Ladder** game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game consists of two main pages:

- **Home Page** (`index.html`): Where players can enter their names and start the game.
- **Game Page** (`game.html`): Where the actual game is played, featuring a dynamic board with snakes, ladders, dice, and player tokens.

The game follows the classic **Snake and Ladder** board game, where players roll a dice to move their tokens up and down ladders or snakes, respectively, until one player reaches the last square on the board.
